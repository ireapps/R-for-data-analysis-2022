As a reminder, always add your packages at the top of your script We'll use the `readxl` package to import an .xlsx file

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

For this exercise we'll be working with the poverty data from yesterday and some MLB salaries data.

```{r}
poverty <- read_csv("data/poverty.csv")
mlb <- read_csv("data/mlb.csv")
```

# mlb

**mlb**: from 2021, the starting salary of every major league baseball player, courtesy of USA Today. Excludes bonuses. Note that the position field is coded:

-   1B = first base
-   2B = second base
-   3B = third base
-   C = catcher
-   OF = outfield
-   INF = infield
-   SS = shortstop
-   SP = staring pitcher
-   RP = relief pitcher
-   DH = designated hitter

### Sorting and filtering

`arrange()` is used to re-order your data.

`filter()` is used to subset your data, based on criteria you set inside the function

Q: which major league baseball player makes the most money?

```{r}
mlb %>% arrange(desc(salary))
```

Q: which starting pitcher makes the most?

```{r}
mlb %>% 
  filter(position=="SP") %>% 
  arrange(desc(salary))
```

Q: who is the best paid player on your favorite team?

```{r}
mlb %>% 
  filter(team=="St. Louis Cardinals") %>% 
  arrange(desc(salary))
```

Q: How many players make over \$1M? \$10M?

```{r}
mlb %>% filter(salary > 1000000)
mlb %>% filter(salary > 10000000)
```

Q: How many players make the league minimum?

```{r}
mlb %>% summarise(minimum = min(salary))
```

```{r}
mlb %>% filter(salary==570500)
```

Q: How many pitchers are there?

```{r}
mlb %>% filter(position %in% c("SP", "RP"))
```

### Summarizing

use `summarise()` to reduce multiple values down to a single summary

What is the total payout for mlb salaries?

```{r}
mlb %>% summarise(total_payout = sum(salary))
```

What is the average salary in mlb? (hint: average is `mean()`)

```{r}
mlb %>% summarise(avg_salary = mean(salary))
```

Compare average and median salaries:

```{r}
mlb %>% summarise(avg_salary = mean(salary), median_salary = median(salary))
```

What are the average and median salaries for your favorite team?

```{r}
# look at one team
mlb %>% filter(team =="Chicago White Sox") %>%
  summarise(mean(salary), median(salary), n())

# compare two teams (in the same city):
mlb %>% 
  filter(team=="New York Mets" | team=="New York Yankees") %>%
  summarise(avg_salary = mean(salary), median_salary = median(salary))
```

# Poverty data

**poverty**: comes from American Community Survey 5-year data from 2020, and measures the population at various levels of poverty, broken out by county. The Census Bureau defines poverty thresholds somewhat differently than HHS which determines eligibility for federal programs, and also has supplemental poverty measures that are different than the primary thresholds, which for 2020 are as such:

### Creating new columns

As we noted yesterday, to do fair comparisons of populations in poverty we need to create percentages or rates rather than comparing raw numbers. To do this, we'll need to create calculated columns in our **poverty** dataset using the `mutate()` function:

```{r}
poverty %>% 
  mutate(pct_below200 = below200/population) %>%
  select(population, below200, pct_below200)
```

First make sure that your calculations looks correct, and then we'll finalize the results by re-writing the `poverty` variable:

```{r}
poverty <- poverty %>% mutate(pct_below200 = below200/population)
```

Q: which county has the highest percentage of people living below 200% of the poverty level?

```{r}
poverty %>% arrange(desc(pct_below200)) %>% 
  select(state, county, pct_below200)
```

Q: How many counties have at least 50% of residents living below 200% of the poverty threshold?

```{r}
poverty %>% filter(pct_below200 >= .5)
```

Q: What is the national pct of people who live below 200 pct of the poverty level?

```{r}
poverty %>% 
  summarise(sum(below200)/sum(population))
```

Q: What pct of people in your state live below 200 pct of the poverty level?

```{r}
poverty %>% 
  filter(state=="") %>% 
  summarise(sum(below200)/sum(population))
```
